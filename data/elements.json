We&rsquo;re all for great sheep-y feta with its kicking hooves, but sometimes we go all-goat for a kinder, gentler flavor. Known for their award-winning chevres, Vermont Creamery applies traditional Greek feta-making methods into practice using 100% farm-fresh goats&rsquo; milk that results in soft, citrusy cheese. They use a lower-salt brine, which allows the mild goat flavor to shine its bright notes without overpowering its mellow creaminess. A truly versatile cheese, you can crumble in salads, use in savory baked dishes, or serve with pita for a simple afternoon delight. Crisp white wines pair best, or a dry ros&eacute; to help you find that mellow sweet spot.","name":"Goat Feta","photos":["http://www.murrayscheese.com/media/catalog/product/f/r/fresh_feta_french_goat_1.jpg"],"tags":["vermont creamery","fresh cheese","goat cheese","feta","Greek"],"thumb":"http://www.murrayscheese.com/media/catalog/product/f/r/fresh_feta_french_goat_2.jpg","updateAt":{"$date":1430081141714}}

Elite quality Spanish \"Coupe\" Saffron is so good you just need to follow the adage \"less is more\" as just a pinch will go a very long way. This is because of the exceptionally quality of this specific crop, in comparison Saffron with an ISO rating of Category 2 (150-170 color score) yields just one fourth the potency of our product. Saffron botanical name is Crocus Sativus, it is estimated that it takes a little more than 14,000 stigmas to produce only one ounce of saffron (Did you know they are picked by hand?). So remember you are paying for quality and that will become evident as you smell and use this wonderful \"Coupe\" variety from Spain.
